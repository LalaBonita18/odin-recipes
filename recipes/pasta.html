    <h1>Pasta Carbonara</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>


<h3>Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings</h3>

<li>10 ounces diced pancetta</li>

<li>16 ounces spaghetti</li>

<li>4 large egg yolks</li>

<li>2 cups grated parmesan cheese</li>

<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

<li>2 cups cooked chicken breast</li>

<li>1 tablespoon italian parsley</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>

<li>Cook pancetta in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>

<li>Boil spaghetti in lightly salted water for 5 minutes. Drain pasta and reserve 2 cups pasta water.</li>

<li>Meanwhile, add egg yolks to a large mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>

<li>Gradually pour 1 1/2 cups hot pasta water over egg yolks, whisking vigorously, making sure to whisk constantly so eggs do not scramble.</li>

<li>Whisk in Parmesan cheese, then heavy cream.</li>

<li>Add cooked pasta, pancetta, and chicken to the sauce, toss to combine. Transfer pasta mixture to prepared dish.</li>

<li>Bake until hot and sauce has thickened, 20 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>

<li>Remove from heat, stir and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes allowing sauce to continue to thicken. Additional pasta water can be added, as desired, for a saucier pasta.</li>

<li>Garnish with parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
